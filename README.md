Use this to troll your friends into thinking you have your friend Hackerman teach you how to hack.
- Step 1. Copy this javascript: javascript: prompt("Type something in BET")
- Step 2. Press the star next to the URL link. 
- Step 3. Press more on the bottom left corner of the bookmarks area.
- Step 4. Delete the web adress or URL. Example: www.github.com/3L33tmakersUnited
- Step 5. Replace that empty area where the URL was with the Javascript that you copied earlier.
- Step 6. Delete out the site name and replace it with something you want it to be named or type in HACKERMAN TUTORIAL Part 1.
- Step 7. Investigate why I named it Part 1. 
- Step 8. Troll your friends into thinking you are epic at hacking.
- INSTRUCTION MANUAL: If the program is done corectly, it should say the site name, Type something in BET, a text box, a cancel button, and an ok button. If you type something in and it appears on a blank white screen, you did it correctly. To go back to the site you previously were on, press the reload button or Cntr + R if you are a tryhard. THE ONLY PLACE IT WILL NOT WORK WILL BE ON THE NEW TAB SCREEN. OTHER THAN THAT IT SHOULD WORK.
